‚ùó Notes
-Supported Data: URLs/plain text
-Tested on PC and iPhone - phones may have to utilize the 'long-press' function to save the photo to your photo library. The download button will prompt you to save it to your phone's 'Files' app instead.
-Tip: On iPhone, you can long-press saved QR codes in your photo library, and a menu will pop up with an option to 'Open in Safari' if you need to visit a site from a saved QR code.
